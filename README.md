# K8SMLEndpoints

Repository that tries to show how to implement SageMaker like endpoints in Kubernetes.

## Goals

* Provide a simple way to deploy ML models in Kubernetes
* Provide a simple way to swap models under the same endpoint in Kubernetes
* Provide a simple way to scale the number of replicas of an endpoint in Kubernetes
* Provide a simple way to monitor the health of an endpoint in Kubernetes
* Provide a simple way to do A/B testing of models in Kubernetes
* Provide a simple way to do canary testing of models in Kubernetes
* Provide a simple way to do blue/green testing of models in Kubernetes
